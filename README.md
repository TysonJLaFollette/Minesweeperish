# Minesweeperish
Minesweeper clone. Written in Java.

List of things to finish:
Make the visits field into a local function variable instead.
Separate game logic and display logic code into separate functions within MainGame class.
Separate game logic and display logic out of MainGame class. Move game logic to MineField class and display logic to GameWindow class.
